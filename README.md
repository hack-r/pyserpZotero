## What does it do?

_pyserpZotero_ is a Python library designed to automate the search, management of scholarly literature citations, and attachment of free PDFs to Zotero citations. It leverages the power of SerpAPI for reliable access to Google Scholar and utilizes the Zotero service for efficient citation management. The library simplifies the process of searching for academic papers, downloading them (where available for free), and organizing citations directly into your Zotero library.

_pyserpZotero_ offers the following functions for (semi-) automating literature review tasks:

- _SerpZot_ (class) - Instantiates a SerpZot object for API management.
  - **SearchScholar** - Searches Google Scholar for papers corresponding to 1 or more search terms and captures their identifiers.
  - **Search2Zotero** - Pulls references from Google using identifiers from _SearchScholar_, converts to Bibtex via CrossRef, reformats for Zotero, looks for PDFs, and uploads to your Zotero cloud library (results will automatically sync to the desktop client, if installed).
  - **CleanZot** - Attempt to remove/replace broken LaTex and other formatting in titles.

## Why SerpAPI?

I'm not a shill for their company, but after a decade of scraping data I've gotten tired of code breaking due to upstream changes, dealing with
proxies, and concerns over intellectual property. SerpAPI handles those things for you. They offer a free tier, which is currently 100 searches
per month and decent pricing.

I may add a proxy scraper later with logic for directly scraping Scholar and other portals, but have been hesistant to do so due to the potential for upstream changes and other risks.

## How to configure it?

You'll need to provide an API key for serpAPI and Zotero, as well as a Zotero library Id. You can either provide these directly as arguments to
the functions, via the interactive mode, or manage them more securely via a YAML configuration file, as in the _Example Usage_ below.

## How to use it?

Beginning with v1.1 an interactive mode is available by entering `psz` into a terminal. See quickstart.ipynb for a Jupyter notebook demonstration of API access.

## What's new?

- Interactive mode! Just enter `psz` in a terminal after `pip install pyserpZotero` to use this library as a program. You can enter your credentials when prompted or edit the config.yaml file to bypass interactive authentication.
- Added support for additional portals and PDF sources, including **medArxiv and bioRxiv**. Improved matching of citations to Arxiv PDFs.
- Now you can add multiple queries together and just leave the program to run. To add multiple queries in the interactive mode just type semi-colon (;) separated words. For example:
  - Searching is provided using:
    1. SerpAPI
    2. Arxiv Search
    3. medArXiv Search
    4. bioArxiv Search
    There is also functionality to skip any platform for searching. For example, if one does not want to search using SerpAPI, one can provide the option `NO_SERP=True` in the config.yaml. All the following options are available for skipping searching on a platform:
      1. `NO_SERP=True`: Skip searching using SERP_API
      2. `NO_MEDARXIV=True`: Skip searching on medArxiv
      3. `NO_BIOARXIV=True`: Skip searching on bioArxiv
      4. `NO_ARXIV=True`: Skip searching on arXiv

```
  Enter one or more (max upto 20) search terms/phrases separated by semi-colon(;): Cancer Research; Humanoid Robot; DNA mutation
```

## Why do you sometimes align assignment operators across lines like that?

As a data scientist, I'm a programming polyglot and long-time R programmer. Following top style guides for R, some of us like our code to be readable by human beings without wasting much time on it - it's a trick for easily making the code structured.
